     <Documentation>
      <Summary>If several addresses are maintained for one communication type, the user in the SAP System can be reached under one of these addresses. One address can be set as theStandard Address.</Summary>
      <LongDescription>The standard address is used for the following functions:When sending using the  SMTP nodein SAPconnect, the home address of the communication type used is the one set as the sender address. The recipient can see this address in the sender information and can also reply directly to this address. The standard address is also transferred and can be used for incoming status notifications, for example.When sending using an RFC node in SAPconnect, the standard address of the communication type used is the one set as the sender address. The structure defined in the case of the RFC does not permit another address to be transferred, so the standard address is used for incoming status notifications too.The SAP users have the addresses of their exchange P.O. boxes in their standard communication type 'Internet Mail' as the home address and their Internet address in the SAP system as their standard address. Example:Home address: Bernard.Brown@Company.comStandard address: Bernard.Brown@System.Company.comSending using an SMTP nodeThe home address of the communication type 'Internet Mail' (Bernard.Brown@Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address the user receives directly in the exchange postbox.Sending using the RFC nodeThe standard address of the communication type 'Internet Mail' (Bernard.Brown@System.Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address, it arrives back to the SAP system.Example using a mail system groupThe users should get all messages in their Microsoft Exchange postboxes. In the SAP system the mail system group is activated for this using the setting "Send Messages to the Home Address".The address settings of the SAP users remain unchanged:Home address: Bernard.Brown@Company.comStandard address: Bernard.Brown@System.Company.comSending using an SMTP nodeThe home address of the communication type 'Internet Mail' (Bernard.Brown@Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address the user receives directly in the exchange postbox.Sending using the RFC nodeThe standard address of the communication type 'Internet Mail' (Bernard.Brown@System.Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address it arrives back in the SAP system. It is then forwarded using the mail system group to the home address and the user gets it in the exchange postbox.</LongDescription>

      <Summary>The country for the telephone number or fax number is maintained here.</Summary>
      <LongDescription>This specification is used to determine the correct country code. A normalized form of the telephone number or fax number is then derived and stored in a field for a program-driven search.In most cases, the telephone number or fax number refers directly to an address.If this is the case, when a new number is created, the country of the address is proposed.If this is not the case (for example, with address-independent communication data for a business partner), the country from the user parameter LND is proposed (if it is maintained). If the user parameter LND is not maintained, the country of the company address assigned in the user master data is proposed.If the country of the address changes, the country of the corresponding telephone number and fax address is not changed automatically.Example: A business partner moves abroad.If the telephone number is for a permanent connection, the telephone number also changes when the business partner moves and has to be maintained again in the system.If the telephone number is for a mobile telephone and the number is retained, the original country for this telephone number also has to be retained and must not be changed automatically to the new country of the address.</LongDescription>

In the delivery, the route proposal also takes the weight group into account.A particular customer always requires immediate delivery. You enter the appropriate shipping condition into the customer master record. This means that when you process orders for this customer, the system automatically proposes the express mail room as a shipping point and the quickest way to the airport as a route.If a shipping condition has been assigned to a sales document type in Customizing, this condition will be proposed by the system in the corresponding sales document.

      <LongDescription>Checking Logistics DocumentsThe system checks whether the invoice documents have already been entered in the Logistics invoice verification. For this, the system checks invoices that have been held or parked or that contain errors, or invoices that were entered for invoice verification in the background. The check is performed only if you specify the reference document number when you enter the invoices.When checking for duplicate invoices, the system compares the following specified characteristics:VendorCurrencyCompany CodeGross Invoice AmountReference Document NumberInvoice Document DateIf all of these characteristics are the same, the system issues a message for which you can change the message type in Customizing.When you enter credit memos or subsequent adjustments, the system does not check for duplicate invoices.Exception: The exception is the Argentina country version, where the system checks for duplicate invoices and credit memos.No message is issued if you enter a document that has previously been reversed.In Customizing for Logistics Invoice Verification under Incoming Invoice -&gt; Set Check for Duplicate Invoices, you can specify that the following characteristics are not checked:Reference Document NumberInvoice Document DateCompany CodeHaving fewer attributes to check increases the likelihood that the system will find a duplicate invoice.Example:The following document has already been entered and posted:Reference Document Number 333Invoice Date: 4/28/2000Gross Invoice Amount 100.00Currency: EURVendor: SpencerCompany Code: ChicagoYou have set up the check for duplicate invoices as follows in Customizing:The characteristics Reference Document Number and Company Code are not activated. Consequently, these characteristics are not checked.Now you enter the following invoice:Reference Document Number 334Invoice Date: 4/28/2000Gross Invoice Amount 100.00Currency: EURVendor: SpencerCompany Code: FlagstaffResultBecause you entered a reference document when you entered the invoice, the system checks for duplicate invoices. Compared against the invoice entered earlier, the invoice just entered has different values in the characteristics Reference and Company Code. However, these characteristics are not checked due to the settings that you have made in Customizing. All other characteristics are the same. The system issues a message telling you that an invoice has been entered twice.If the characteristic "Reference Document Number" had been selected in Customizing, the system would have checked the reference document number and established that it was different from the invoice entered earlier, and it consequently would not have issued a message.Checking FI DocumentsThe system checks whether there are FI documents that were posted or parked with the Logistics invoice verification or with an FI invoice transaction. Depending on the entry in the Reference field, one of the following checks is performed:If a reference number was specified in the sequential invoice/credit memo, the system checks whether an invoice/credit memo has already been posted for which all the following attributes agree:Company CodeVendorCurrencyDocument DateReference NumberIf no reference number was specified in the sequential invoice/credit memo, the system checks whether an invoice/credit memo has already been posted for which all the following attributes agree:Company CodeVendorCurrencyDocument DateAmount in Document CurrencyIn Materials Management, the system applies the check for duplicate invoices for invoices only, not for credit memos.</LongDescription>

      <Summary>Date on which a legal dunning procedure was initiated.</Summary>
      <LongDescription>The printing of dunning notices in the legal dunning procedure generates an internal notice about any further account movements. A dunning notice is not created for the customer.If the Legal dunning procedure field in the master record contains a date, this means that the account is involved in a legal dunning procedure. The relationship between this date and the dunning date does not affect how the account is processed.The printing of account movements in the legal dunning procedure differs from the normal printing of dunning notices as follows:You must specify a separate form for your dunning procedure in Customizing. For more information, see Customizing (IMG) under Dunning Forms.The dunning program also displays text element 520 "Legal dunning procedure". This makes it possible to display the date of the legal dunning procedure from the master record.The program also displays the documents blocked for dunning and those with a payment method (automatic debit, bank direct debit).Although dunning notices are printed, the dunning level does not change in the master record or in the items. New dunning level = old dunning level.The program only updates the date of the last dunning run.Enter the date manually.</LongDescription>

      <LongDescription>You can define shipping conditions in your system which correspond to the requirements of your company. You can specify a shipping condition in the customer master and in the vendor master.Shipping point determination (outbound delivery):The loading group, the plant and the shipping condition determine the shipping point that will be proposed by the system.Route determination (outbound delivery):Apart from the country and the geographical region of the shipping point, the ship-to party and the transportation group, the shipping condition determines the route that the system proposes in the order for the delivery of the goods. In the delivery, the route proposal also takes the weight group into account.A particular customer always requires immediate delivery. You enter the appropriate shipping condition into the customer master record. This means that when you process orders for this customer, the system automatically proposes the express mail room as a shipping point and the quickest way to the airport as a route.If a shipping condition has been assigned to a sales document type in Customizing, this condition will be proposed by the system in the corresponding sales document. If there is no assignment, the system copies the relevant data from the corresponding customer master record of the sold-to party. You cannot change this value during delivery processing. The shipping condition will not be copied from the delivery into the shipment. The shipping condition is one of several criteria for selecting deliveries when you create a shipment. You can enter a shipping condition manually in the shipment where it only serves as a characteristic for grouping shipments.</LongDescription>
