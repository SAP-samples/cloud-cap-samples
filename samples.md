# All-in-one Monorepo

Each sample sub directory essentially is a standard npm package, some with standard npm dependencies to other samples. The root folder's [package.json](package.json) has local links to the sub folders, such that an `npm install` populates a local `node_modules` folder and acts like a local npm registry to the individual sample packages.
