# Welcome to cap/samples

Find here a collection of samples for the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap) organized in a simplistic [monorepo setup](samples.md#all-in-one-monorepo).

![](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Get Started

Assumed you did your [initial setup of CAP Node.js](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/#setup), simply copy & paste these lines to a terminal for a jumpstart:
    
```sh
git clone -q https://github.com/sap-samples/cloud-cap-samples cap/samples
cd cap/samples
npm install
npm test
npm start
```

After download and setup this starts the bookshop server and opens a browser window on _http://localhost:4004_ looking like that:

<p align="center">
   <img width=480 src="etc/index-html.png" alt="bookshop showing up in browser" />
</p>

Click on the *[/vue](http:/localhost:4004/vue)* link at the top to display the bookshop app (when asked to log in, type `alice` as user and leave the password field blank).

## Grow as you go...

After the jumpstart, have a look into the enclosed sub folders/projects, which are:

- [bookshop](bookshop) â€“ a simplistic [primer app](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/in-a-nutshell)
