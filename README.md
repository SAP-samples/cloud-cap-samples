## Get Access to SAP Business Application Studio

In SAP Business Application Studio, open a terminal.
Then clone the repo with this specific branch:

git clone https://github.com/sap-samples/cloud-cap-samples -b projects/openSAP-week2-unit4567
cd projects/cloud-cap-samples
```

In the `cloud-cap-samples` folder run:

## Run

Now you're ready to run the samples, for example:
